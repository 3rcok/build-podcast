##Development

Each episode's show notes and source code are added to this repository

- git branch `master` has source code for each episode

- git branch `gh-pages` has the [main website]((http://build-podcast.com)) contents with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). 

When preparing the show notes in local machine, execute the following in the command line:

   - `jekyll serve --watch --config _dev_config.yml` to start the [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) server with development configurations
   - `grunt` to start the [GruntJS](http://gruntjs.com/) continuous compilation for CSS and JavaScript
