##Equipment and tools used for capturing and editing:

Big thanks to the open source community and free softwares!

1. [C01U USB Studio Condensor Microphone](http://www.samsontech.com/samson/products/microphones/usb-microphones/c01u/)
1. [SwitchResX 4](http://www.madrau.com/download/latest/latest.html) to switch my screen resolution to `1280 x 720` and keep my notes in a dual monitor to refer while speaking and recording
1. [Audacity](http://audacity.sourceforge.net/) and [Audio MIDI Setup](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_MIDI_Setup) to check sound quality
1. [Quicktime](http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/) to record the screencasts
1. [mouse locator](http://mouse-locator.en.softonic.com/mac) to highlight portions during screencast
1. [keycastr](http://download.cnet.com/KeyCastr/3000-2075_4-125977.html) to display your keystrokes while recording screencasts
1. [iMovie](http://www.apple.com/ilife/imovie/) to edit the screencasts and export `*.mov` video file
1. [ffmpeg](http://ffmpeg.org/) for video and normalised audio exports
1. [Sox](http://sox.sourceforge.net/) for normalising audio
1. [Levelator](http://www.conversationsnetwork.org/levelator) for audio normalisation (if sox is not used)
1. I have written [several command line scripts for automation](https://github.com/sayanee/build-podcast/tree/master/automation) for starting, continuing, recording and publishing each episode.
