####[Build Podcast](http://build-podcast.com) is a show about technology tools for design and development. Each episode, [Sayanee](http://sayan.ee) will be creating a screencast that will take you through step-by-step in using one tool to build a little project, all in the fun spirit of hacking, creating and building stuff!

##Synopsis

Each episode uses a [MAC OS X Mountain Lion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS_X_Mountain_Lion) operating system in a [MacBook Pro machine](http://support.apple.com/kb/sp541) and assumes that the viewer has an intermediate level of understanding in development of software/hardware to pick up new tools for building stuff.

Why a show on **tools** you might ask? Because humans are essentially **tools builders**, and we have [an immense chance to shape our envionment](https://vimeo.com/34017777) in that way.

> We shape our tools and then our tools shape us. ~ Marshall McLuhan

> Computers are like a bicycle for our minds. ~ Steve Jobs

Most importantly, [Build Podcast](http://build-podcast.com) is a direct reflection of my personal journey into the vibrant world of technology throughout the [layers of abstraction in modern computing](https://twitter.com/sayanee_/status/277641534441136128). Every other week or so, I discipline myself to go in depth into just one tool and in the process, share it with the entire world.

If you found Build Podcast useful, [i would be really happy to hear it](http://twitter.com/sayanee_) and get your ideas on what technology tool I should next pick up!

##Upcoming

I wanna learn a tonne of things. Here are some stuff I wanna pick up, go in depth and use in my daily dabbling with technology. These will probably take me more than a couple years to learn, but it's exciting!
