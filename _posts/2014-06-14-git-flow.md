[Git Flow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) is a git branch model. In this episode, we will create a git repository and then add the git flow branching model to it. We will also explore how to start a feature, hotfix of a release with the command line or SourceTree App. Finally, we will find out how to display the git commits in a graph.

##Background on Git Flow

1. [A successful Git branching model](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)
1. [Original github repo](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow) and [updated fork](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow/issues/329)
1. [Git Flow AVH](https://github.com/petervanderdoes/gitflow)

##Things to learn with Git Flow

###1. install

1. [install](https://github.com/petervanderdoes/gitflow/wiki) git-flow avh edition. E.g. for [Mac OS X](https://github.com/petervanderdoes/gitflow/wiki/Installing-on-Mac-OS-X)
1.install with [brew](http://brew.sh/)

	```
	brew install git-flow-avh
	```
1. try out the command in the terminal

	```
	git flow version
	git flow
	```

###2. start a normal git repo

1. create a file `cal.md` to include notes on the [Cosmic Calendar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_Calendar)
1. initialise a git repo as we normally do

	```
	git init
	git add cal.md
	git commit -m "initial commit"
	```
1. pretty git log graphs

	- some [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1057564/pretty-git-branch-graphs) examples  for `git log` commands
	- with [gitx](http://gitx.frim.nl/)

1. edit `cal.md`

	```
	##Big Bang

	- 1 Jan: Big bang
	- 15 Mar: Milky Way Galaxy formed
	- 31 Aug: Sun formed
	- 16 Sep: Oldest rocks on Earth
	```
1. commit it

	```
	git status
	git add cal.md
	git commit -m "Big bang cal added"
	```
1. view the commits as `git log` command and with `gitx`

###3. integrate git flow

1. integrate git flow in an existing repo

	```
	git flow init
	```
1. answer the questions accordingly

	```
	Which branch should be used for bringing forth production releases?
	   - master
	Branch name for production releases: [master]
	Branch name for "next release" development: [develop]

	How to name your supporting branch prefixes?
	Feature branches? [feature/]
	Release branches? [release/]
	Hotfix branches? [hotfix/]
	Support branches? [support/]
	Version tag prefix? []
	Hooks and filters directory? [.git/hooks]
	```
1. notice that the branch is automatically in `develop`

	```
	$ git branch

	* develop
  master
	```

###4. new feature

1. start a new feature on the feature-name branch

	```
	git flow feature start earth-cal
	```
1. some earth calendar is added to `cal.md`

	```
	- 21 Sep: prokaryotes
	- 12 Oct: photosynthesis
	- 29 Oct: Oxygenation of atmosphere
	- 9 Nov: complex cells (eukaryotes)
	```
1. commit it

	```
	git add .
	git commit -m "added sep-nov earth cal"
	git branch
	git log
	```

1. another feature branch

	```
	$ git flow feature start human-cal
	$ git branch
	```
1. some edits

	```
	##Human

	- 30 Dec: Primates
	- 31 Dec, 06:05: Apes

	```
1. commit it

	```
	git add cal.md
	git commit -m "some human events added"
	```
1. go back to another feature branch `feature/earth-cal`

	```
	git checkout feature/earth-cal
	```
1. complete the calendar for earth

	```
	...
