We will go through some of the common config files and their settings on both Mac OSX and AWS EC2. Lastly, we will also go through what is the `.htaccess` file and some of its configurations.

##Things to learn with Apache

###1. install and config files

####on a mac osx

1. MAC OSX comes with a pre-installed Apache. Check it's version:

    ```
    httpd -v

    Server version: Apache/2.2.22 (Unix)
    Server built:   Aug 24 2012 17:16:58
    ```

1. Explore `httpd.conf` file contents:
    1. open the main configuration file with a text editor. it might be usually found in `/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf` as well.

        ```
        subl /private/etc/apache2/httpd.conf
        ```
    1. search for the following lines in the config file to learn about them from the surrounding comments:

        ```
        …
        ServerRoot
        …
        Listen
        …
        DocumentRoot
        ```
1. open the hosts file in a text editor. it might be also found in `/etc/hosts`:

    ```
    subl /private/etc/hosts
    ```
1. Change the Document Root:
    2. go to the `DocumentRoot` and create a simple `index.html`. start the apache server and visit [localhost](http://localhost) in the browser.

        ```
        sudo apachectl start
        ```
    1. change the `DocumentRoot` to another location with an index.html. Then stop and start the apache server

        ```
        …
        DocumentRoot "/Users/username/Desktop"
        …
        <Directory "/Users/username/Desktop">
        …
        ```
1. Change the vhosts - allows you to run several websites from a single computer
    1. uncomment the line in the file `httpd.conf`:

        ```
        Include /private/etc/apache2/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf
        ```
    1. edit the `httpd-vhosts.conf` file

        ```
        <VirtualHost *:80>
          ServerName project.localhost
          DocumentRoot "/location/to/the/project"
          <Directory /location/to/the/project>
            AllowOverride All
            Order allow,deny
            Allow from all
          </Directory>
        </VirtualHost>
        ```
     1. include the name in the `hosts` file

     ```
     127.0.0.1     project.localhost
     ```

####on a linux distro (aws ec2)

1. create a new EC2 instance and ssh into the virtual server

    ```
    ssh -i mykey.pem ec2-user@[public-dns]
    ```
1. after getting inside the virtual server, install the apache server

    ```
    yum install httpd
    ```
1. explore the various files and folders by opening them up in a text editor, `nano` in this case

    ```
    nano /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
    nano /etc/hosts
    ls -al /var/www/html

    ```

###1. .htaccess file

1. about `.htaccess`:
    - `.htaccess` code works in the `httpd.conf` file, but not all `httpd.conf` code works in `.htaccess` files
    - a directory level apache configuration file
    - used generally for speeding up website, debugging and security
1. simple rewrite url

    ```
    # simple rewrite
    RewriteEngine On
    RewriteRule ^about$ about.html
    ```
1. add custom error pages

    ```
    ErrorDocument 404 /404.html
    ```
1. expires headers

    ```
    <IfModule mod_expires.c>
      ExpiresActive on
      ExpiresDefault                          "access plus 1 month"
      ExpiresByType image/gif                 "access plus 1 month"
    </IfModule>
    ```
1. custom header

    ```
    Header set Join-Us "Looking for a job? Email us!"
    ```
