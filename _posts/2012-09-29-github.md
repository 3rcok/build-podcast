##Tools used for Github:

1. [Github](http://github.com/)
2. [Git](http://git-scm.com/)

####Using Github to find open source projects

1. [Explore](http://github.com/explore)
2. [Repositories](http://github.com/repositories)
3. [Languages](http://github.com/languages)

####Using Github to explore one particular open source project

Explore the following various tabs and buttons:

1. code
2. network
3. pull requests
4. issues
5. graphs - contributors, commits, code frequency, impact, punchcard
6. files
7. commits
8. branches
9. ZIP

####Share your code with everyone through Github

In your computer:

- Create [new repository](https://github.com/new) and github will give clear instructions on the git commands to upload the repository to github
- Initiate your project in your own machine first

```
touch README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/sayanee/projectname.git
git push -u origin master
```

- Push an existing repository from my machine to github

```
git remote add origin https://github.com/sayanee/projectname.git
git push -u origin master
```
- Note some information on your remote repository with the command line `git remote` or `git remote show origin`

- Make changes to the project locally on my machine

```
git add .
git commit -m "added the changes"
```

- Push to github again

```
git push origin
```

- Explore the various Github tabs: code, network, pull requests, issues, wiki, graphs, admin

####Create issue and fix an issue

1. Go to the project page in Github > Tab 'Issue' > New Issue
2. If you are the repository owner, you can close the issue with the git commit message and the issue number (e.g. issue number 3): `git commit -m "fixed #3"`

####Fork a repository, change and pull request

1. Go to a github project page to which you want to contribute
2. `Fork` the project to make a copy to your github account as well
3. Make a local copy of the project with `git clone https://github.com/username/projectname.git folder-name`
4. Make a new branch to work on the new feature with `git branch -b branch-name`
5. Push to your github repository with `git add .` and then `git push origin branch-name`
6. Visit the Github repository page and ensure the branch is set to the feature branch.
7. Click `Pull Request`
