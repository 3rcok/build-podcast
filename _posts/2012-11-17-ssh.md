[Secure Shell (SSH)](http://www.openssh.com/) is a program to securely log in to another computer over a network and execute commands in that machine. In this episode, we will look into how to generate keys, ssh configurations, secure copy, known hosts and even [AWS](http://aws.amazon.com/) login.

##Things to learn with SSH

We will work with 2 computers: [client and server](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client%E2%80%93server_model). The server can be another computer in the same network as the client, a web host provider (most common), [aws](http://aws.amazon.com/), etc.

####1. background on ssh

In the client computer, in the command line:

1. check ssh version with `ssh -V`
1. check the manual for ssh with `man ssh`
1. locate the program file for ssh with `which ssh`


####2. login/logout the server computer

In the client computer, in the command line:

1. `ssh username@hostname` with password and it's just like logging into another computer
1. when we login for the first time, the hostname will get added to the file `~/.ssh/known_hosts`
1. `ls` to look at the folders and files in the current directory
1. `cd` to change dirctories
1. `logout` to exit the server computer

####3. create encryption keys

We will work with 2 command line tabs:

1. **SERVER**: `ssh username@hotname`
1. **CLIENT**: `cd ~/.ssh`

In the client's command line:

1. generate encryption keys: `ssh-keygen -t rsa -f learnssh -C "sayanee@gmail.com"`
1. generate the fingerprint seperately: `ssh-keygen -l -f filename.pub`
1. secure copy and transfer the generated encryption key to the server's home directory: `scp -p learnssh.pub sayanee@10.0.1.21:`

In the server's command line:

1. check that `learnssh.pub` has indeed been transferred with `ls -al learnssh.pub`
1. concat the contents of `learnssh.pub` to the file `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` with the command `cat learnssh.pub > ~/.ssh/authorized_keys`
1. uncomment line `AuthorizedKeysFile %h/.ssh/authorized_keys` inside the file `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`
1. `logout` exit
1. this time there won't be any password prompt. login again with `ssh username@hostname`
1. `logout`

In the client's command line:

1. create a file `~/.ssh/config` with the following in the content:

    ```
    Host ubuntubox
    Hostname 10.0.1.21
    User sayanee
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/learnssh
    ```
In the server's command line:

1. how we can login with a shorter command `ssh ubuntubox` without any password prompt

####4. ssh with amazon web services (aws)

1. go to [aws](http://aws.amazon.com/) > My Account/Console > AWS Management Console > Amazon Web Services > EC2
1. Left Column > Instances > Instances > Launch Instance
1. Through the Wizard > 5 steps:
    1. Choose an AMI> Choose Ubuntu Server Free Tier
    1. Instance Details > choose default/continue
    1. Create Key Pair > Create a new Key Pair > `learnsshaws` > Create and download your key pair > `learnsshaws.pem`
    1. Configure firewall > default/continue
    1. Review > default/continue
1. Click the instance, and copy the public DNS address
1. copy the downloaded `learnsshaws.pem` to folder `~/.ssh`
1. change the permission with `chmod 600 learnsshaws.pem`
1. login to aws via ssh `ssh -i /Users/username/.ssh/learnsshaws.pem -v ubuntu@publicdns`
1. to login such a long ssh command, amend the `~/.ssh/config` file with the following contents:

    ```
    Host awstest
    Hostname aws-public-dns
    User ubuntu
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/learnsshaws.pem
    ```
1. now we can login to aws with a shorter command and no password with `ssh awestest`
